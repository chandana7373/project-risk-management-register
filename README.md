# Project Risk Management Register

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Risk Register** developed as part of a Project Risk Management assignment. The objective of this project is to identify, analyze, prioritize, and respond to risks that may impact project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality.

The risk register was created using industry-standard risk management practices and aligns with PMBOK and Pritchard’s risk management framework.

## Methodology
1. Risks were identified using structured techniques recommended by Pritchard.
2. Each risk was mapped to a specific Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) item or the overall project.
3. Qualitative analysis assessed probability and impact to prioritize risks.
4. Quantitative analysis calculated EMV for each risk to determine contingency reserves.
5. Risk response strategies were defined and documented.
6. Risks were sorted and monitored throughout the project lifecycle.
